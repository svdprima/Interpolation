# Interpolation
MIPT Hometask on Computational Mathematics

Lagrange polynomial, Newton polynomial and cubic Spline. Polynomials start to diverge due to round-off error 
when the number of points is approximately 50.

Input: vector of initial points, vector of values and vector of points for interpolation.
Output: vector of interpolated values.
